# RPS-Multiplayer

### Description

This application is a multiplayer rock, paper, scissors application that you can play against other people. There is a chat on the bottom of the page aswell to taunt the person you are playing against. You won't be able to talk in the chat unless you have joined the lobby at the top of the page. Upon joining the lobby you are given a role (player1, player2, or waiting), if you are player1 you will always go first, if you are player2 you are always second, and if you are waiting you can't play but can talk in the chat. If a player leaves and you are the waiting role, you have to refresh the page and reenter the game.
